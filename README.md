## Overview
A lightweight tiling [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) written in C++ over Xlib.

## Build Requirements
* gcc (>= 5.2, maybe)
* make
* Xlib headers

## Windows Version
Just fook off

## What's working
* Move windows with `Super + MouseLeftBtn`
* Resize windows with `Super + MouseRightBtn`
* Launch rofi with `Super + d`
* Kill applications with `Super + q`
* Fullscreen applications with `Super + f` (this one is glitchy)
* Window border
* Click to focus
* _NET_WM_NAME set to "Wmderland"
* Recognizes polybar (because I use polybar lol)

## What will be added
* Workspaces
* Tiling
* Configuration support
* ...
